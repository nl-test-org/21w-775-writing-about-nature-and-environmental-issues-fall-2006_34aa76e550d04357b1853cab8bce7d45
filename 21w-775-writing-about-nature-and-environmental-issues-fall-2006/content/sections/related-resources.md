Class Blog
----------

There is a community blog for this class (see below). The purpose of the blog is to allowÂ students to work through key ideas and texts for the class in a less formal kind of writing that allows them to see each other's work and comment on it constructively. Blog entries will not be graded individually, but will count collectively as another essay grade as part of the final grade for the class.
